# PixelGeneticAlgorithm

## Personal Project

### Name
Pixel Genetic Algorithm

### Year
2018

### Overview
This project implements a genetic algorithm where the color of each pixel (represented by [R, G, B] values) acts as a chromosome within a population. The primary objective is to evolve this population towards a target color.

### Features
- **Dynamic Evolution**: Users prompt evolution to the next generation through mouse clicks.
- **Population Adjustment**: Ability to change the number of pixels (individuals) in the population.
- **Target Adaptation**: The target color is randomized after the population successfully evolves to match the current target color.

### Visuals
Below are examples demonstrating the evolution process and adaptation to new target colors. (Note: Actual images from the project would be inserted here.)

### How It Works
At the core of this project is a genetic algorithm that operates on the principles of selection, crossover, and mutation. Each pixel's color represents a unique individual in the population, striving to evolve towards a predefined target color. The fitness of each individual is determined by its closeness to the target color. Users can influence the evolution process and observe the population as it adapts to new target colors introduced at various stages of the experiment.
